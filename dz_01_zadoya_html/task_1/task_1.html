        <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
        <article>
            <h3>ACT 1</h3>
            <h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
            <p>Two households, both alike in dignity </br>
                (In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),</br>
                From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</br>
                Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</br>
                From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</br>
                A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;</br>
                Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</br>
                Doth with their death bury their parents strife.</br>
                The fearful passage of their death-marked love</br>
                And the continuance of their parents rage,</br>
                Which, but their childrens end, naught could remove,</br>
                Is now the two hours traffic of our stage;</br>
                The which, if you with patient ears attend,</br>
                What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
            <h3>SCENE 1. Verona.A public place</h3>
            <p id="p_italic">Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed wirh swords and bucklers</p>
            <h3>SAMPSON</h3>
            <p>Gregory, o my word, well not carry coals.</p>
            <h3>GREGORY</h3>
            <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
